# GitHub PR Workflow for PR #$ARGUMENT$

## Primary Task
Retrieve the latest Claude review comment from the specified pull request and initiate an interactive conversation to help me decide which feedback items to apply.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Get PR Review Information
- Fetch the latest Claude review comment from the specified PR
- Parse and organize the feedback items clearly
- Identify the scope and nature of each suggestion

### 2. Get last changes and move to branch
- Go to main branch and fetch the latest changes.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --rebase
```

- Checkout to the pull request branch.

```bash
git checkout PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH_NAME
```

### 3. Present Feedback Summary
Display the review feedback in a structured format:
- **Critical Issues**: Security, bugs, or breaking changes
- **Code Quality**: Performance, maintainability, best practices
- **Style/Convention**: Formatting, naming, documentation
- **Suggestions**: Nice-to-have improvements or alternatives

### 4. Interactive Discussion Framework
For each feedback item, ask me:
- Do you agree with this feedback? (Yes/No/Partially)
- What's your reasoning for applying or not applying it?
- Are there any constraints or context I should consider?
- Would you like me to help implement this change?

### 5. Decision Tracking
Keep track of:
- ‚úÖ Feedback to implement
- ‚ùå Feedback to skip (with reasoning)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Feedback that needs clarification
- üîÑ Feedback requiring further discussion

### 6. Implementation Planning
For accepted feedback:
- Prioritize changes by impact and effort
- Identify dependencies between changes
- Suggest implementation order
- Offer to help with code modifications

### 7. Document Decisions in PR
Write a summary comment in the PR that includes:
- Overview of review feedback received
- Decision rationale for each feedback item
- List of changes that will be implemented
- List of feedback items declined (with reasons)
- Timeline or next steps for implementation
