# ü§ñ dotclaude - Agentic Programming Flow for Claude Code

**Transform your development workflow with AI-powered automation from issue definition to implementation and review.**

dotclaude is a Claude Code configuration that enhances [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) with custom commands, creating a complete agentic programming flow - where AI handles the entire development lifecycle from understanding requirements to implementing solutions and addressing review feedback.

## ‚ú® The Agentic Programming Flow

Our three-phase workflow automates the entire development process:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[üìù Define] --> B[üöÄ Implement] --> C[‚úÖ Review]
    A --> |"/new-gh-issue"| A1[Research codebase<br/>Understand problem<br/>Create detailed issue]
    B --> |"/start-working-on-issue"| B1[Setup environment<br/>Implement solution<br/>Run tests<br/>Create PR]
    C --> |"/review-pr-comments"| C1[Address feedback<br/>Fix issues<br/>Update PR]
```

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Define** (`/new-gh-issue`)
Claude researches your codebase, understands the problem context, and creates a comprehensive GitHub issue with implementation details.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Implement** (`/start-working-on-issue`)
Claude automatically sets up the development environment, implements the complete solution, runs tests, and creates a pull request - all in one command.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Review** (`/review-pr-comments`)
Claude addresses PR review comments, makes requested changes, and updates the pull request until it's ready to merge.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Full Automation**: From issue creation to PR merge - Claude handles the entire workflow
- **Remote Execution Ready**: Designed for implementation on remote machines
- **Context-Aware**: Claude understands your codebase structure and conventions
- **Quality First**: Automatic linting, type checking, and test execution
- **Git Best Practices**: Properly formatted commits with issue references
